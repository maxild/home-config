# If you want to use 256 colors, you need to enable 'color256' option which
# then makes lf use sgr 8-bit color escapes (e.g. '\033[38;5;4m').
# This option is intended to eliminate differences between default colors
# used by ls and lf since terminals may render 3-bit and 8-bit escapes
# differently even for the same color.
set color256 on
